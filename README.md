# Todo

- [x] bootstrap terraform remote state in azure
- [x] test creating azure application with rotating secrets
- [x] test creating github secret
- [ ] make a module
- [ ] make the secrets stronger

# Notes

The design will probably be:

- repo with service principal creator / rotator
- repo that deploys something into azure
